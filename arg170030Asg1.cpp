/******************************************************************************
 * Simple Series Program.
 *
 * The program requests a number greater than 1.  If zero is entered, the
 * program stops. If a number equal to 1 or less than 0 is entered, the program
 * should give an error and return to request another number. The same is true
 * for entering anything other than a number.
 
 * If the number entered is N, sum the series 1/N + 2/N-1 + 3/N-2+ â€¦ N/1.
 * Display the original number and the sum.
